1) MovieName and movie_time variables are assigned as nonstatic variables.
    ---> non static variables means. They are specific to objects.
    ---> static variables means they are class specific. we can assign static variable using static keyword(ex: String static movieName;)
2) MovieName and movie_time variables are assigned as Global scope.

 --> global scope means they are available throgh the entire object or class;
 --> variables assigned outside of methods will be in global scope
 --> variables assigned inside the methods will be in local scope
